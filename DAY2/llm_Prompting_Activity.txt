### Activity 1
================
step 1: prepare your dataset
data = [ "genai is subset of Deeplearning",
        "langchain helps build llm applications",
        "FAISS is used for similarity search",
        "oracle23 ai is vector database"]
|
|
Convert Text ->Embeddings
|
stores to FAISS 
|
Query the vectorstore
---------------------
 loaded_vectorstore.similarity_search(query,k=N) # get top N values 
  |
get the results
|
use enumerate(result) - iterate - index - response.page_content //data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Activity 2
================
Read a regular text file: Create a function that uses standard Python file handling (preferably the with open() statement for automatic resource management) to read the entire content of a specified text file into a string variable.

Use llm model try the following llm activities 
1. Summarization

Summarize the content using an LLM: Pass the string containing the file's content to a Large Language Model (LLM) via an appropriate API or library call.
Display the response: Print the concise summary generated by the LLM to the console.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Activity 3 
================
Given Corpus
corpus='''Dr.Sarabhai is considered as the Father of the Indian space program;
He was a great institution builder and established or helped to establish a large number of institutions 
in diverse fields.
He was instrumental in establishing the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad : 
after returning from Cambridge to an independent India in 1947, he persuaded charitable trusts controlled by his family and friends to endow a research institution near home in Ahmedabad. Thus, Vikram Sarabhai founded the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947. He was only 28 at that time. Sarabhai was a creator and cultivator of institutions and PRL was the first step in that direction. Vikram Sarabhai served of PRL from 1966-1971.
He was also Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission.
He along with other Ahmedabad-based industrialists played a major role in the creation 
of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.'''

From the above corpus - try the following llm use cases
1. Grammar and text correction
2. Text to structure format (ex: YAML,JSON)
